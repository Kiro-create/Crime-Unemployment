# Unemployment and Crime Rate: An Analytical Perspective

This project explores the relationship between unemployment rates and crime across U.S. states. Using statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and real-world datasets, we examine whether economic instability correlates with increases in violent and property crimes. The findings aim to inform public policy and contribute to the discourse on social justice and economic resilience.
