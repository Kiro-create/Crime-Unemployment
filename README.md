# 🔍 Unemployment and Crime Rate: An Analytical Perspective

> *"When jobs disappear, stability trembles. But does crime always follow?"*

Welcome to our data-driven investigation into one of society’s most pressing questions: **Does unemployment drive crime?**

In this project, we dive deep into U.S. state-level data spanning decades to examine whether economic hardship—measured through unemployment rates—can predict fluctuations in both violent and property crimes. Combining statistical rigor with storytelling through data, we present our findings in a comprehensive report, an interactive notebook, a detailed academic poster, and a live presentation.

Whether you're a policymaker, a data enthusiast, or a curious mind, this project offers insights into how economic and social factors intertwine—and how data can help us untangle them.
